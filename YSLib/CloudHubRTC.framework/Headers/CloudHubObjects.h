 - The dimension does not specify the orientation mode of the output ratio. For how to set the video orientation, see [CloudHubVideoOutputOrientationMode](CloudHubVideoOutputOrientationMode).
 - Whether 720p can be supported depends on the device. If the device cannot support 720p, the frame rate will be lower than the one listed in the table. CloudHub optimizes the video in lower-end devices.
